# Moneyball
Using clustering techniques to explore a baseball dataset and identify players that are either overvalued or undervalued. Completed for Syracuse University IST707

## Project Overview
Everyone is familiar with the movie Moneyball and the problems Billy Beane took on as the GM of the Oakland Athletics. With the help of advanced analytics, could the right baseball players be identified that would allow a small market team to compete with bigger teams that simply bought the best players?  

Please look at the accompanying slides and report for further details on this baseball dataset.
